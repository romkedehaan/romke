## Strategy, Development, UX/UI

When thinking about the future people tend to just react to trends and focus on what they are missing. I need a website. I need a social media strategy. Can I use blockchain? What is machine learning vs ai?

What individuals need to focus on is value. 

Am I delivering value to those receiving it? Do I get value from what I deliver?

Value can be many things. The delivery of that value is important. Technology can be a catalyst in creating momentum in the delivery of value. Itâ€™s how Blockbuster got beat out by Netflix. Amazon in retail. Rideshares and taxis. 

With over 20 years of experience, I can help deliver insights and research that inform your business to deliver improved value to your customers.
