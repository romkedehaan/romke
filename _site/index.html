      <h2 id="strategy-development-uxui">Strategy, Development, UX/UI</h2>

<p>When thinking about the future people tend to just react to trends and focus on what they are missing. I need a website. I need social media strategy. I should buy some bitcoin. What individuals need to focus on is value. Am I delivering value to those receiving it? Do I get value from what I deliver?</p>

<p>Value can be many things. The delivery of that value is important. Technology can be a catalyst in creating momentum in its delivery. Itâ€™s how Blockbuster got beat out by Netflix. Amazon in retail. Rideshares and taxis.</p>

<p>With over 20 years of experience, I can help deliver insights and research that inform your business to deliver improved value to your customers.</p>
